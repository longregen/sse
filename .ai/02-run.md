Can you spot any anomalies in the logs for that?
ChatGPT

Apologies for any confusion, but your prompt looks like the output of a script running in a terminal. It appears that the script is processing a project directory, analyzing its files, and excluding certain file types like '.gitignore', LICENSE, Makefile, etc. It seems to be splitting the files into chunks, probably for further processing.

Can you provide more context or ask a specific question?
User
I'm looking for anomalies in the number of chunks of the files. Maybe some file has a huge number or zero.
ChatGPT

Looking through the output, I don't see any files that have zero chunks which would imply that they are empty or not being processed correctly.

In terms of files with a large number of chunks, these are the top ones:

    src/lib/babylon/avatars/CharacterController.ts - split into 11 chunks
    src/lib/babylon/scene/scene-context.ts - split into 13 chunks
    src/lib/babylon/avatars/AvatarRenderer.ts - split into 8 chunks
    src/lib/babylon/scene/AssetManager.ts - split into 8 chunks
    src/lib/babylon/scene/BabylonEntity.ts - split into 7 chunks
    src/explorer/Renderer.tsx - split into 7 chunks
    src/lib/babylon/scene/logic/raycasts.ts - split into 6 chunks
    src/lib/babylon/scene/logic/easings.ts - split into 5 chunks
    src/explorer/Nav.tsx - split into 5 chunks
    src/explorer/console.ts - split into 5 chunks

These numbers are not necessarily anomalies but may just indicate that these are larger files with more content to process. However, without knowledge of what this process is meant to do, it's hard to say if this is expected behavior or not. For a more detailed investigation, it may be useful to examine the content of these files or the logic of how the script is splitting files into chunks.

If there's a specific anomaly or unexpected behavior you're concerned about, please provide more details and I'd be happy to help further!
User
Based in this database (using python, connecting to psycopg2), please help me to create a function in python that takes a question, uses a query like `SELECT * FROM items WHERE id != 1 ORDER BY embedding <-> (SELECT embedding FROM items WHERE id = 1) LIMIT {limit};` (with extensions),
ChatGPT

Sure, here's a basic function that you can use as a starting point. This function connects to your PostgreSQL database, and runs a query which finds items most similar to a given item (based on an "embedding" column), ordered by similarity:

python

import psycopg2

def get_similar_items(item_id: int, limit: int):
    conn = None
    try:
        conn = psycopg2.connect(
            dbname="your_dbname",
            user="your_username",
            password="your_password",
            host="your_host",

User
Sorry, I forgot to give you the schema:

def create_tables_if_not_exists(db_conn):
    cursor = db_conn.cursor()

    cursor.execute("""
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS source_embeddings (
            content_hash TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
            model_id TEXT,
            created_at TIMESTAMP
        )
    """)
    cursor.execute("""
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS file_info (
            id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
            file_path TEXT,
            content_hash TEXT REFERENCES source_embeddings(content_hash),
            created_at TIMESTAMP
        )
    """)

    cursor.execute("""
        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS chunk_embedding (
            id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
            model_id TEXT,
            chunk_hash BYTEA,
            chunk_data TEXT,
            chunk_embedding vector(768),
            source_hash TEXT REFERENCES source_embeddings(content_hash),
            created_at TIMESTAMP
        )
    """)

    db_conn.commit()
ChatGPT

No problem. Let's update our function to fit your database schema. I'm assuming that the vector datatype in your chunk_embedding table refers to an array of numbers (since Postgres doesn't have a native vector type) and that we are looking for similar items based on the chunk_embedding data. However, if my assumption is incorrect, please feel free to clarify.

Please replace the dbname, user, password, and host with your actual credentials.

Here is the updated function:

python

import psycopg2
import psycopg2.extras
import numpy as np

def get_similar_chunks(source_hash: str, limit: int):
    conn = None
    try:
        conn = psycopg2.connect(
            dbname="your_dbname",
            user="your_username",
            password="your_password",
            host="your_host",
            port="your_port"
        )

        query = """
            SELECT * FROM chunk_embedding
            WHERE source_hash != %s
            ORDER BY chunk_embedding <-> (
                SELECT chunk_embedding FROM chunk_embedding
                WHERE source_hash = %s
            )
            LIMIT %s
        """

        with conn.cursor(cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.DictCursor) as cur:
            cur.execute(query, (source_hash, source_hash, limit))
            records = cur.fetchall()

        # Convert the records into a list of dictionaries for easier processing
        records_list = []
        for record in records:
            records_list.append(dict(record))

        return records_list

    except (Exception, psycopg2.DatabaseError) as error:
        print(error)
    finally:
        if conn is not None:
            conn.close()

This function get_similar_chunks takes a source_hash and limit as input, connects to your PostgreSQL database, and runs a query to find the limit number of chunks that have embeddings most similar to the chunk with the provided source_hash.

The function returns a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a record from the chunk_embedding table.

Remember to catch the exceptions in your production code and handle them appropriately.
User
That's good, but I want the results to have:
* id, file_path, content_hash, created_at from 'file_info' table
* source_embeddings.model_id from 'source_embeddings' table
* a concatenation of all the source_chunk_index that matched

In order to do this, the search has to happen on the table "chunk_embedding", with the results being joined with the other tables. Let's think step by step how to build the "get_similar_chunks" function
ChatGPT
2 / 2

Firstly, let's clarify the task:

    We are searching for chunks similar to the chunk of the source_hash provided.
    For each similar chunk found, we want to know its source_chunk_index, as well as the details of the corresponding file from the file_info table and the model_id from the source_embeddings table.
    If a file has more than one similar chunk, we concatenate the source_chunk_index values.

I assume there's a missing source_chunk_index field in your chunk_embedding table, because it's necessary to refer to the chunk's index in the file. Please correct me if I'm wrong.

The SQL query might be complex, but it's doable. We will use a subquery to find similar chunks, then JOIN with file_info and source_embeddings to fetch extra details. We use GROUP BY to group results by file, and array_agg function to concatenate source_chunk_index values.

Here's the updated function:

python

def get_similar_chunks(source_hash: str, limit: int):
    conn = None
    try:
        conn = psycopg2.connect(
            dbname="your_dbname",
            user="your_username",
            password="your_password",
            host="your_host",
            port="your_port"
        )

        query = """
            WITH similar_chunks AS (
                SELECT id, source_chunk_index, source_hash
                FROM chunk_embedding
                WHERE source_hash != %s
                ORDER BY chunk_embedding <-> (
                    SELECT chunk_embedding FROM chunk_embedding
                    WHERE source_hash = %s
                )
                LIMIT %s
            )
            SELECT 
                file_info.id, 
                file_info.file_path,

                file_info.created_at, 
                source_embeddings.model_id
        """

        with conn.cursor(cursor_factory=psycopg2.extras.DictCursor) as cur:
            cur.execute(query, (source_hash, source_hash, limit))
            records = cur.fetchall()

        # Convert the records into a list of dictionaries for easier processing
        records_list = []
        for record in records:
            records_list.append(dict(record))

        return records_list

    except (Exception, psycopg2.DatabaseError) as error:
        print(error)
    finally:
        if conn is not None:
            conn.close()

This code is still an approximation because I made assumptions about the source_chunk_index field and how the data is organized in your database. Let me know if you need further adjustments.

That's great. I modified the query to be:
```

            source_embeddings.model_id,
            array_agg(similar_chunks.source_chunk_index) as matched_chunk_indices,
            array_agg(similar_chunks.chunk_data) as matched_chunk_indices
        FROM similar_chunks
        JOIN file_info ON file_info.content_hash = similar_chunks.source_hash
        JOIN source_embeddings ON source_embeddings.content_hash = file_info.content_hash
        GROUP BY

            file_info.created_at, 
            source_embeddings.model_id
        LIMIT %s
```
Now, I'd like to take all the chunks' vector_distance (which is a float number) and calculate the average, and sort through that field. could you make that change for me?

Sure, here's the updated SQL query for you. In this version, the code aggregates vector_distance using the avg function to calculate the average distance for each file. Then it orders the final results by this average distance in descending order.

sql

WITH similar_chunks AS (
    SELECT id, source_chunk_index, source_hash, chunk_data, chunk_embedding <-> %s as vector_distance
    FROM chunk_embedding
    ORDER BY vector_distance DESC
)
SELECT 
    file_info.id, 
    file_info.file_path, 
    file_info.content_hash, 
    file_info.created_at, 
    source_embeddings.model_id,
    array_agg(similar_chunks.source_chunk_index) as matched_chunk_indices,
    array_agg(similar_chunks.chunk_data) as matched_chunk_data,
    avg(similar_chunks.vector_distance) as avg_vector_distance
FROM similar_chunks
JOIN file_info ON file_info.content_hash = similar_chunks.source_hash
JOIN source_embeddings ON source_embeddings.content_hash = file_info.content_hash
GROUP BY 
    file_info.id, 
    file_info.file_path, 
    file_info.content_hash, 
    file_info.created_at, 
    source_embeddings.model_id
ORDER BY avg_vector_distance DESC
LIMIT %s

You might notice that the ORDER BY vector_distance DESC inside the CTE similar_chunks becomes redundant because it does not affect the ordering of the final results. We're ordering the final results by the average distance instead. So you can remove that if you wish.
